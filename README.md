# Unity-Stuff
A place for all the Unity projects I make

This project is supposed to be my very first completed game. Requested to me by a friend. The idea is simply to create a bullet-hell game that is heavily inspired by the Touhou franchise. Graphics currently in the game are placeholder and will later be provided by said friend.
